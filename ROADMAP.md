# Roadmap

Planned features and improvements for StoatBridge. Priorities may shift based on community feedback.

## Next Planned Tools

- **Moderator Hub** — Central place for server owners/mods to moderate their servers (actions, logs, queues, and moderation utilities)
- **Custom Server Creator** — Easier server creation with guided setup, presets, and quick configuration
- **Roles Bot** — Dedicated bot for role management (role menus/reactions, self-assign roles, role sync, and role automation)

## Later Down the Line

- **Server Backup & Restore** — Export/import server structure, roles, and key settings
- **Automation & Workflows** — Rules like “if X happens, do Y” (auto-role, auto-mod, routing)
- **Templates & Presets Library** — Community templates for common server types (gaming, community, creator, etc.)
